    <p>Snow Leopards are cute big cats that live up in the mountains of Mongolia, China, Afghanistan, and many other Central Asian Countries.
      While they look very adorable, these danger floofs are hunters that will hunt goats and other various animals that inhabit these mountainous
      regions. One habit that is a bit interesting about the cats is their adorable tail holding technique. Snow leopards will hold their 
      tails in their mouths but many are confused as to why the big cats do that in the first place. There are two main theories believed
      to be fact for why this is done. The first, is the fact that it works as a sort of muffler for the creatures. When they hold the tail
      in their mouths it is believed to act as a blocker for the very cold temperatures they deal with high in the mountains. Thus, it allows
      them to handle these arctic tempuratures and keep away frost bite. Now while this is good enough of an explanation, there is also 
      a much cuter one. Some believe that it is simply a fun activity the cats partake in. As a sort of play behavior it's believed they do this 
      in captivity settings to just stave off boredom or to also just partake in play behavior. Whichever of the two reasons for the snow leopards
      to do this, we can all agree on the fact that the world is a better place for them doing it at all.

      <h4>How high can a Snow Leopard Really Jump?</h4>

    <p>Snow Leopards are cute big cats that hang out on the sides of mountains, and in various snowy areas. Since the terrain they
      inhabit is so angular and weirdly shaped as a result of the mountain texture, their navigability of their 
      surroundings is superb. This helps especially as the animals that inhabit the mountain with them are equally as versed in 
      climbing so if they weren't up to snuff with them it would be a difficult fight to keep enough food for themselves and their cubs.
      One special feat of this challenge that they have developed is the fact of their jumping height, as needing 
      to climb mountians on a day to day basis would lead to needing to be able to move up them easily. So when it comes to the
      height they can jump, they can reach up to FIFTY FEET in height. For reference, snow leopards at most are 
      around 4.25 feet in length, which means that they can jump over 10 TIMES their height, that is a very springy creature. I can't even 
      imagine trying to get myself to jump more than twice my height on a good day! For seome reference, here are some snow leoaprds 
      in captivity, and their recorded jumping heights:
